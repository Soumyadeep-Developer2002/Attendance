It is a Biometric Attendance System. 
I used Flask here. Here i am use 3 python file.
1. All kinds of logic are written in the App.py. It is the main file.
2. The logic of Register page, Login page, Enroll Teacher Page, Class Photo upload Form, Complaint form is written in the Forms.py. So Jinja2 Snippet kit has been used in all HTML file, Which has reduce the work on the Frontend part.
3. In Models.py here I write Database logics. In that file there are so many tables like 'Institute_Details', 'Student_Details', 'Teacher_Details', ClassPhoto etc etc...

This project can be used for Biometric Attendance System through Machine Learning. So some more changes can be made here when it is integrate with ML.
